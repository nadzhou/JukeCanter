# JukeCanter
Applying the Juke Canter model on familial bacterial genome to understand mutation rate and specific biases. 

## Motivation
Nature acts differently from purely random processes. We need to understand how genomes deviate from purely random processes. There is no obvious way to do this. The Juke Canter model provides a very simple way of understanding this.  

## Goals 
The goal here is to build a user friendly tool that can easily show differences in familial bacterial mutation rate versus what we see as a result of purely random process.
